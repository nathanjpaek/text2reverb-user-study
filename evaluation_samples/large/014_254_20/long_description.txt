A metal railing, attached to a set of stairs ascending towards a lit area at the top, stands out against the dark backdrop of a cave. The stairs are illuminated by the light from the top, casting a warm glow that highlights the texture of the metal. The cave walls, which appear to be a dark gray or brown color, surround the stairwell and contrast with the lighter tones of the stairs. A small light source is visible near the top of the stairs and seems to be attached to the railing, rather than a light fixture within the cave. The floor of the cave is a light brown or tan color, possibly rock or sand.
