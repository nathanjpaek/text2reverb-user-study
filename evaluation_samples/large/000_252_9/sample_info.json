The seats stretch out towards the stage, which is also adorned with orange/brown panels. The stage is bathed in a warm, golden light, contrasting with the darker tones of the theater. The walls are primarily a beige or light tan color, with sections of wood paneling visible. A railing runs along the edge of the stage.",
