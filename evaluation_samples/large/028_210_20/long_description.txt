A spacious, modern atrium features a light-colored tiled floor that reflects the soft glow of the ceiling, which is adorned with numerous lights. A central wooden staircase with a metal railing on either side leads to a second level, where several dark-colored chairs and tables are arranged. Behind the tables, a portion of a dining area also be seen. The walls are painted a light green color, providing a pleasant backdrop to the surroundings, and are punctuated by large windows that allow natural light to flood the space. The atrium is well-lit, with artificial lighting also visible. In the background, a painting, possibly a sculpture, can be seen on the wall, and several other levels and areas within the atrium are visible.
