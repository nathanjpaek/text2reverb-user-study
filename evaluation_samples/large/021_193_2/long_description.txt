An indoor sports complex, bathed in bright light, features a vibrant blue floor contrasting with the pristine white walls. The floor is marked with crisp blue and red lines, home to several athletic tracks that crisscross the space, appearing ready for action. The high ceiling is adorned with several lights, illuminating the space further.  The walls are punctuated by large windows that allow natural light to filter in, casting a warm glow over the area. In the center of the room, a large white bench invites athletes to rest and soak up the energy of the arena. There are also some equipment storage areas or garages visible in one part of the image. A large scoreboard or video board is on the wall at the far end of the space.
