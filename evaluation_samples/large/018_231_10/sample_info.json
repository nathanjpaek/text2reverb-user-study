A large crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, casting a warm glow over the space. Flanking the staircase are potted plants, adding a touch of nature to the elegant setting. White walls with decorative molding and paneling contrast with the polished wood flooring. A large square rug, with intricate border patterns, covers the floor, enhancing the overall aesthetic. On the right side of the entryway, a black console table holds an arrangement of vases and decorative items. On the left, a small, upholstered bench invites visitors to sit and relax.
