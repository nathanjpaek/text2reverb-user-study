  "description": "An empty indoor gymnasium features a vibrant yellow wall contrasting with a cool gray floor marked with yellow lines. Two wooden benches are situated along the wall.  A black microphone stand with a microphone is positioned on the right side of the image. A black cable runs across the floor. A section of a white wall is visible in the background, and the gymnasium has metal support beams and panels across the ceiling. While there are some markings on the floor, they are not clear enough to confirm if they are graffiti.",
