A metal pipe runs along the left wall, and a wooden structure, possibly a frame or part of a machine, is visible in the foreground. Two metal poles stand near the center, one with a curved top and the other with a flat top.  A black metal object, possibly a boom mic stand, is placed in the center of the room. The room is illuminated by a light source that casts shadows on the floor. A wooden beam or structural element is visible on the wall near the center. The image captures a raw and unused space, with no furniture or decorations present.",
